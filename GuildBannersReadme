Welcome to this opensource guild bannersystem for rotmg private servers. It was coded by Claude the AI, and prompted by
me Shangapallia.

Now, first navigation. New stuff is on the client and server side to make this work.
Client: by going src -> kabam -> rotmg -> customguildbanners you will find a big batch of files.
although there are other files that are created/edited. But let us begin with the batch.

It can be divided into three sections: 1. the UI, 2. the Data Pipeline, 3. the Activation System.

The UI: ColorPicker draws the Color Wheel of the UI. SimpleButton creates the foundations for buttons, which then
are managed in the BannerManager. BannerManager is where everything for the UI is initalized. Of course though that
class is initialized in Gamesprite. BannerDrawSystem is the canvas that is drawable. BannerStorage stores your banners
you create, so when you Export/Save it gets saved to that.

The Data Pipeline: AutonomousBannerSystem sends the data from BannerStorage to the server.
The framework is that all clients will load the data on GameSprite connect (the
game world connect). This means that the clients have the data to load the different guild-banners when needed. This can
be preferable than the server doing the heavy-work, which is generally good practise. BulkBannerSystem retrieves and
stores the data for future use.

The Activation System: so you have two options either ClientBannerRendering, or BannerActivate. THe renderer renders a
vector of the data on the screen, while the activate, renders it in the gameworld where a person placed a banner.
Basically, the activation runs every time someone places down a banner, so that it gets loaded with the right data from
the BulkBannerSystem.

Then the stuff outside the batch. //815602 is the code both in the client and server of where in the files listed
there is something edited. This will be of great help.
